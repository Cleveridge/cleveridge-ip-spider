##What is the Cleveridge IP Spider
The Cleveridge IP Spider searches for open TCP ports of a single IP-address or a IP-range and returns the open ports with an indication of the service behind the open ports.    

When scanning a range of IP's it will run multiple threads at the same time to save time. In one scan procedure you will be able to scan a range of 256 IP's (xxx.xxx.xxx.0-255)

##Tested
At this moment the Cleveridge IP Spider is only tested in a Linux Kali environment with Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 installed.     
The Cleveridge IP Spider is also successfully tested in combination with Proxychains 3.1 (http://proxychains.sourceforge.net/) and Tor (https://www.torproject.org/) to hide the ip of the user.

##On the first run...
...the Cleveridge IP Spider will automatically install the following folders:    
- log : in this folder all the log files of scans will be saved    
- cnf : configurations folder    
- data : in this folder the user can store files containing lists of ip addresses he/she wants to scan (not available yet)
